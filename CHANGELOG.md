# Changelog

## 0.1.0-experimental.4

- Replace drag-to-create folders with an explicit `New folder` action.
- Render persona thumbnails and folder cards with matching 80×80 images;
  clicking a folder opens its contents as a distinct drop zone.
- Move personas into an opened folder or folder card, back to the unfiled
  area, or before another persona without overlapping drop actions.
- Record startup-cache outcome and probe/request/hydration timings in
  PocketRisu System Logs.
- Reopen cache validation after isolated cold/warm measurement confirmed a
  database 200→304 path but found substantial non-cache startup work.

## 0.1.0-experimental.3

- Separate persona drop targets visually and behaviorally: a highlighted row
  creates or joins a folder, while a highlighted gap only reorders.
- Execute the last displayed iPhone drop target instead of resolving the
  finger position again at touchend, preventing an adjacent reorder gap from
  replacing a visible folder action.

## 0.1.0-experimental.2

- Keep persona HTML drag desktop-only so PocketRisu's iOS drag polyfill cannot
  preempt the popup's 400 ms long-press reorder controller.

## 0.1.0-experimental.1

- Add one composable patch engine with `features` and `all` artifacts.
- Import bg-preserve v1.0.0 as 116 exact hooks and 55 owned files.
- Add authenticated ETag-validated PocketRisu startup database caching adapted
  from PocketRisu PR #49.
- Add persona folders, desktop/touch drag-to-move, and drag-to-reorder.
- Add SHA-256 pack ETags, collision-only ordering, partial file recomposition,
  transactional writes, interrupted-write recovery, drift refusal, and exact
  apply/revert round-trip tests.
