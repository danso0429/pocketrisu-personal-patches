# Changelog

## 0.1.0-experimental.2

- Keep persona HTML drag desktop-only so PocketRisu's iOS drag polyfill cannot
  preempt the popup's 400 ms long-press reorder controller.

## 0.1.0-experimental.1

- Add one composable patch engine with `features` and `all` artifacts.
- Import bg-preserve v1.0.0 as 116 exact hooks and 55 owned files.
- Add authenticated ETag-validated PocketRisu startup database caching adapted
  from PocketRisu PR #49.
- Add persona folders, desktop/touch drag-to-move, and drag-to-reorder.
- Add SHA-256 pack ETags, collision-only ordering, partial file recomposition,
  transactional writes, interrupted-write recovery, drift refusal, and exact
  apply/revert round-trip tests.
